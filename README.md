# ETL-Project
Group project

We pulled data from YouTube via their public APIs.  We then saved that data to csv files (2) and json (1).
We then loaded the csv files and the json file into dataframes and inserted that data into mongodb.
Once loaded, we were able to pull the data back out of mongodb and put it all back into dataframes.
